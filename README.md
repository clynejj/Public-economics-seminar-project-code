This repository solves and simulates the model for my new seminar paper titled: 'How does household time use behaviour respond to policy changes? Evidence from Australia.' The results can be obtained by running the notebook in 'Time_Use.ipynb' and the final paper pdf is now uploaded. 

Inspiration for the model comes from Thomas Jorgensen's course Household Behavior Over The Lifecycle, see the course material here: https://github.com/ThomasHJorgensen/HouseholdBehaviorCourse .
